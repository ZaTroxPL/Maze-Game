# Maze-Game
Text based game in the console (finished), WinForms (work in progress) and WPF (not even started) 

There are 2 projects inside this solution:
 - The 1st project "Maze Game" is <b>finished</b> and you can play the game with it, but it runs in the console.
 - The 2nd project, is WindowsFormsMazeGameUI, which is <b>unfinished</b>, I'm using it to learn WinForms.
 - There will also be a 3rd project that i will use to learn WPF.
 
 Read the "User Guide" file if you want to learn more about playing the actual game.
